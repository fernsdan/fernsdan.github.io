        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

                The Atlantic Council's Freedom and Prosperity Center compiled data on a number of variables that help understand (and explain) the difference in freedom and prosperity levels between countries. It includes data from 1995 to 2023. My idea here is to explore this index using outside data, and note interesting patterns that emerge. The first two charts below are a general representation of the two indexes, and the user can select a country to view in detail, comparatively.</p>
