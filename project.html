            <h2>Visualising freedom and prosperity: an exploration</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                For this project, I explored the Atlantic Council's Freedom and Prosperity Center indexes. My idea here was to create connections between the indexes and outside data, which I collated, to note interesting patterns that (hopefully) would emerge. The indexes themselves consist of a several variables that help understand (and explain) the difference in freedom and prosperity levels between countries. It includes data from 1995 to 2023. The first two charts below are a general representation of the two indexes, and the user can select a country to view in detail, comparatively.</p>

        <figure id="project1"></figure>
        <figure id="project2"></figure>

        <div class="chart-description">
            <h2>Income</h2>
            <p>The first variable that came to mind was income, which is included in the prosperity index calculations but not in the freedom index. How much, if anything, does GDP per capita inform about a nation's freedom? I created a scatterplot to visualize this and added a regression line to see the general direction of the relationship. Of course, any econometric claims would require much more careful analysis, but it's not unlikely that income is correlated with trade, bureaucracy or property rights, for example -- all of which are captured by the freedom index.</p>

        <div class="chart-description">
            <h2>Migration</h2>
            <p>The 'hypothesis' behind creating this chart is that so-called 'freer' and more prosperous countries would attract more people who want to migrate. To avoid repetitive charts, I created an average index of the two metrics (Prosperity and Freedom) for each country, on Vega itself using calculations.</p>
             <p>First, I created a chart using regions coded as colours, because I guessed that people probably migrate more within regions than across them. Since migration data is imperfect, and there are several reasons why a person would become a migrant (from conflict and refuge to economic-related reasons), the relationship wasn't immediately obvious:</p>

         <p>When I added an income filter instead, a clearer picture emerged:</p>
