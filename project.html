            <h2>Visualising freedom and prosperity: an exploration</h2>
            <p>For this project, I explored the <a href="https://freedom-and-prosperity-indexes.atlanticcouncil.org/library">Atlantic Council's Freedom and Prosperity Center indexes</a>. The aim is to create connections between the indexes and outside data, which I collated, to note interesting patterns that (hopefully) would emerge.</p>
             <p>The indexes consist of several variables that help understand (and explain) the differences between countries' freedom and prosperity levels. Still, they are descriptive and each dimension is analysed independently — the potential influences between each are not controlled for or measured.</p>
            <p>In terms of <a href="https://freedom-and-prosperity-indexes.atlanticcouncil.org/about">methodology</a>, the <b>freedom index</b> includes (1) economic freedom (property rights, trade freedom, investment freedom, and women’s economic freedom), (2) political freedom (elections, civil liberties, political rights, and legislative constraints on the executive) and a (3) legal subindex (clarity of the law, judicial independence and effectiveness, bureaucracy and corruption, security, and informality). The <b>prosperity index</b> has more parts, it is a weighted average composed of <b>six</b> components: (1) income, given by GDP per capita, (2) environment (CO2 emissions per capita, share of the population with access to clean cooking technologies), (3) minorities (a composition that captures discrimination), (4) health, captured by life expectancy, (5) education (years of schooling) and finally, (6) inequality (after taxes and transfers Gini coefficient).</p>
            <p>Because the index is so broad and rigid in its methodology, it can provide an interesting opportunity to investigate several policy questions.
</p>
            <p>Both indexes have data from 1995 to 2023. The first two charts below are a general representation of the two indexes, and the user can select a country to view in detail, comparatively.

            <h2>Income</h2>
            <p>The first variable that came to mind was income, which is included in the prosperity index calculations but not in the freedom index. How much, if anything, does GDP per capita inform about a nation's freedom? I created a scatterplot to visualize this and added a regression line to see the general direction of the relationship. Of course, any econometric claims would require much more careful analysis, but it's not unlikely that income is correlated with trade, bureaucracy or property rights, for example -- all of which are captured by the freedom index.</p>

            <h2>Migration</h2>
            <p>The 'hypothesis' behind creating this chart is that so-called 'freer' and more prosperous countries would attract more people who want to migrate. To avoid repetitive charts, I created an average index of the two metrics (Prosperity and Freedom) for each country, on Vega itself using calculations.</p>
            <p>First, I created a chart using regions coded as colours, because I guessed that people probably migrate more within regions than across them. Since migration data is imperfect, and there are several reasons why a person would become a migrant (from conflict and refuge to economic-related reasons), the relationship wasn't immediately obvious:</p>

         <p>When I added an income filter instead, a clearer picture emerged:</p>
